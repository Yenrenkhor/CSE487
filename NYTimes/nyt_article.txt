Stocks have staged a remarkable turnaround in the early days of 2019, rebounding after an end-of-the-year tailspin that was fomented by fears of recession in the United States.Three straight weeks of gains in the new year on Wall Street have erased nearly all of 2018’s losses. It’s the best start to a year since 1987.Even so, many factors behind last year’s troubling decline remain unresolved. American companies and consumers are less optimistic about the future, and large economies like Germany and China are signaling a global slowdown driven by the trade war. Britain is in turmoil over leaving the European Union. And a new concern, the longest federal government shutdown in history, also poses a risk to the domestic economy.A month ago, any one of those elements might have fueled a steep decline in stocks. In December, waves of panic-driven selling left the S&P 500 dangling almost 20 percent below its high. Now, it’s all being taken in stride.The difference is an abrupt change in tone from the Federal Reserve. This year began with repeated public assurances from Fed officials that they were sensitive to concerns about the economy and would be patient and flexible as they decided whether to raise interest rates.Investors were alarmed last year by the idea that the central bank was determined to keep raising rates, risking a recession. It wasn’t just Wall Street that worried. As stocks were sliding in December, President Trump, who boasted about stocks as they rose earlier in the year, became fixated on the Fed and its chairman, Jerome H. Powell. “The only problem our economy has is the Fed,” he wrote on Twitter on Dec. 24.“They’re trying their best to be a source of stability in markets,” said Samantha Azzarello, global market strategist at J. P. Morgan Asset Management. “What happened last year really shook people and their confidence in investing in equities.”The Fed has always held sway over the financial markets, but that influence tends to grow in the later stages of an expansion, when every interest rate increase is seen as the one that might trip up the economy.The United States economy is still strong: The unemployment rate is near 50-year lows, wages are starting to rise and growth in corporate profits remains robust. To the Fed, these are reasons to keep raising borrowing costs and stave off potential inflation. It did so four times in 2018.But after 10 years of economic growth, many investors are worried that a turning point is near, and that higher interest rates might bring on a slowdown faster than they expect. And the recent stock market gains may not stick without proof that corporate profits can keep growing.“We’re in a bit of a ‘show me’ moment for skeptical and uncertain investors,” said Kate Moore, chief equity strategist for BlackRock, the world’s largest investment firm. “It’s going to have to be backed up with earnings and the confidence that those earnings are going to be sustainable.”This past week, American companies began disclosing their sales and profits for the fourth quarter. With about 10 percent of companies in the S&P 500 posting results, the reports have been strong.After the S&P 500 rose 2.9 percent in the week through Friday, it is up 13.6 percent from its Dec. 24 low. The stock index ended trading on Friday just below its 2018 starting point.However, earnings reports reflect only what happened in the past. When it comes to how they will do in 2019, some large businesses have cautioned that they don’t have a clear view.Ford recently warned that the trade war and Britain’s impending exit from the European Union made it impossible to offer investors a forecast. The homebuilder Lennar did the same, blaming weakness and uncertainty in the housing market.Broad surveys of sentiment also suggest reason for worry. On Friday, the University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index fell to the lowest point of the Trump presidency and well below forecasters’ expectations. Earlier in the week, a report from the Fed showed that, through early January, executives and economists had become less optimistic for a host of reasons, including trade and political uncertainty and swings in the financial markets.The data in that report came before the government shutdown had stretched to nearly a month. Now the longest in United States history, the closing will start to take a toll. The latest estimates from the White House’s own Council of Economic Advisers suggest that the shutdown has already knocked almost half a percentage point off the economy’s growth rate, though that drag should end once the government reopens.The shutdown is affecting some large businesses already. On Tuesday, Delta Air Lines cautioned that reduced travel by government officials and contractors would hurt its sales growth, at a rate of about $25 million a month. JPMorgan Chase executives noted that if the Securities and Exchange Commission — currently closed except for emergency matters — was not able to give approvals for stock market share offerings, and mergers went unapproved by other government agencies, it could cut fee revenue for its investment banking operations.Profits at American companies may be hurt by the United States’ trade war with China. Evidence that it is slowing global growth mounted this past week, with Germany reporting its slowest annual growth rate since 2013 and China saying that exports fell last month.Companies in the S&P 500 generate 37 percent of their sales, on average, from markets outside the United States, according to the data provider FactSet, and businesses that have increased their exposure to global economies now look vulnerable.But for the most part, stock investors have shrugged off these concerns in January, now that they see the Fed as less eager to raise rates.The Fed had spooked investors as recently as Dec. 19, when it raised interest rates, and its chairman, Mr. Powell, said he didn’t see a need for the central bank to change the way it has been slowly selling off the bonds it bought to bolster the economy over the last decade. The stock market slid 6 percent in the days afterward.“Clearly the market was skittish about, primarily, the Fed,” said Alicia Levine, chief strategist at BNY Mellon Investment Management. “It sounded like the Fed was on autopilot.”Stocks have staged a remarkable turnaround in the early days of 2019, rebounding after an end-of-the-year tailspin that was fomented by fears of recession in the United States.Three straight weeks of gains in the new year on Wall Street have erased nearly all of 2018’s losses.

The stock market slid 6 percent in the days afterward.“Clearly the market was skittish about, primarily, the Fed,” said Alicia Levine, chief strategist at BNY Mellon Investment Management. “It sounded like the Fed was on autopilot.”By Jan. 4, Mr. Powell’s comments had a different tone. Speaking at a public panel discussion, he made a point of emphasizing the Fed’s ability to be patient with further interest rate increases, given that inflation remains low.“We’re listening with, you know, sensitively to the message that — that markets are sending,” Mr. Powell said. “And we’re going to be taking those downside risks into account as we make policy going forward.”Within days, other central bank officials repeated the sentiment, and the Fed published the details of its December meeting, which showed that many of its policymakers had already reached that conclusion. Stocks had already bounced off their Christmas Eve low when Mr. Powell spoke, but have gained 9.1 percent since.“Their commentary has really done a 180 in a really short period of time,” said David Giroux, chief investment officer of United States equity at asset manager T. Rowe Price.Over the last 30 years, investors have grown accustomed to looking to the Fed for help when the market found itself in a sticky spot. Some trace the phenomenon to the October 1987 market crash. The morning after stocks tumbled roughly 20 percent in a single day, the Fed, under the recently appointed Alan Greenspan, issued a statement indicating that it was ready to support the economic and financial system.Stocks rebounded sharply, helping to embed an expectation into the markets that continues today. And, in the past decade, as stocks have climbed in their longest run of gains ever, the Fed’s decisions to back away from plans to raise interest rates or withdraw economic stimulus have helped keep the bull market alive.Mr. Powell and the Fed seem to have done that again.“I think his comments on Jan. 4 were critical to getting excitement and willingness to invest back into the market,” Ms. Levine said.Millions of investors will receive year-end statements from their brokerages and retirement plan managers in the coming weeks, and the great majority of them will have unpleasant news: losses.The S&P 500 finished the year down 6.2 percent, with the steepest declines recorded in the fourth quarter. With Apple’s announcement of disappointing sales in China on Wednesday, the bad times for stocks continued in the first week of the new year. While most economic data has remained strong, there are some rumblings that 2019 may be quite a bit rougher than 2018. Corporate executives are becoming more pessimistic, according to surveys, and Americans are conducting Google searches for the word “recession” at the highest rate since the last one just ended in 2009.If it all makes you want to flee — or at least shift your 401(k) into cash — that’s understandable. It’s also a bad idea.The sensible response to this unnerving series of developments is to do pretty much anything else. Read a book. Go for a walk. Take up knitting. Or just do nothing at all, like take a nap. If you are a long-term investor (and any money you have tied up in the stock market should be intended for the long term to begin with), tumult like that of the last few months isn’t something that should cause panic. Rather, it’s the price you pay for enjoying returns that, over long time horizons, are likely to be substantially higher than those for cash or bonds.That’s true if this episode turns out to be a false alarm for the overall economy, as is a distinct possibility. But it’s also true even if this does turn out to be the start of a prolonged period of economic and market distress — especially if you are still in the phase of your life of contributing to a retirement plan or otherwise accumulating savings.ImageNapping at a brokerage office in Beijing in October.CreditJason Lee/ReutersThe recent pessimistic tone in markets is getting way ahead of the evidence. Nothing so far in either the economic data or the market indicators that most reliably predict economic swings suggests there will be anything worse than a modest slowdown in economic growth in 2019.Businesses are still expanding and adding jobs. The yield on two-year Treasury bonds has fallen in the last three months, but it would have fallen a lot more if the bond market — which tends to be closely tied to the direction of the overall economy — had been predicting an imminent recession.Moreover, an investor who moved money into cash now would be doing so just as the valuation of stocks was becoming more favorable — buying high and selling low, not the way great fortunes are made. That’s especially true when you factor in the drop in longer-term interest rates, which makes shares particularly appealing relative to bonds.In early November, investing $100 in stocks would buy you about $4.64 worth of corporate earnings, versus the $3.21 in interest you would could receive by investing in 10-year Treasury bonds. Now, stocks offer $5.25, while bonds offer only $2.61.But most important, even if the economic road ahead really is as bumpy as some in markets seem to fear, you’re probably not going to be successful at timing those swings just right.Of course, if you had a perfect ability to predict how far the market would fall and when it would bottom out, it would make sense to move money in and out. You do not.There is a wide range of evidence that people are pitiful at timing the market. Even supposed investment experts lack that prescience. Even if you turned out to be right about a continuing tumble in 2019, the great risk would be that whenever the rebound began, you would be caught out of position, unable to take advantage.Suppose you were clever enough to recognize at the start of December 2007 that a major recession was about to take place, and you moved your money out of stocks.Yes, you would have saved yourself from steep losses in 2008 and early 2009. But you have to ask yourself: Would I have also had the courage to put money back in while the economy was still in horrendous shape in 2009, with double-digit unemployment and a banking system in tatters?If not then, when would you have moved money back in? People who simply left their savings fully invested in the stock market in December 2007 have now made a 134 percent return on that money. Would you have done better than that, or would you have missed out on a big chunk of those gains out of the same caution that led you to pull money out of stocks to begin with?People who did not panic in the fall of 2008 — the most panic-worthy time in most of our lifetimes — and kept putting their retirement funds into stocks did indeed incur steep losses over the ensuing months. But their newly invested funds were being put into stocks at the most favorable valuations in a generation, and thus enjoyed the full benefit of the rebound when it eventually came. A truism of economic and financial cycles is that by the time it feels like the coast is clear and putting money into riskier investments is completely safe, the real money has already been made. People who looked at the economic chaos of early 2009 and stuck to their guns have ended up far better off than those who, convinced that a double-dip downturn was imminent, waited for years to get in.This equation changes, of course, if we’re talking about money needed imminently as opposed to longer-term savings, such as for retirement. The economy looks stable now, but that could change — it’s still possible that markets and C.E.O.s know something about the future that isn’t clear in the data yet.But that’s more of a fundamental argument about how your assets should be allocated. If an 18 percent drop in stocks is enough to cause you to change your entire investment strategy, that money shouldn’t have been in stocks to begin with.The entire point of investing in stocks is that you get greater long-term expected returns in exchange for tolerating bigger ups and downs. Episodes like those of the last few weeks are, in effect, the price you pay for returns that are substantially higher than bonds or cash over longer periods. Just as there are no free lunches, there are no excess returns without some volatility and risk.As individual investors, we cannot control volatility. What we can control is our own mind-set and reaction, and the more level your head, the better your long-term results are likely to be.A year ago, in the wake of President Trump’s tax cut, euphoric investors pushed the Dow Jones industrial average past 25,000, a record. The Dow had just gained 25 percent in 2017, and the Nasdaq had leapt 28 percent. Volatility was so low that there wasn’t a single day in 2017 when the S&P 500 fluctuated more than 2 percent.Not everyone was celebrating.“If there are any certainties, one will be that this party will eventually come to an end,” James Stack, president of InvesTech Research, told me a year ago. “And when it ends, it will end badly, and with high volatility.”Mr. Stack turned out to be right. He lowered his recommended asset allocation for United States stocks from 82 percent last January to 72 percent in September, when stocks hit new all-time highs. He urged investors to raise cash in October, and at the end of November he recommended an even more defensive posture — including putting money in a fund whose value would rise when stock prices dropped. That brought his recommended net exposure to stocks to just 55 percent, the lowest since the depths of the last bear market in early 2009.Stocks plunged in December, posting their worst monthly loss since the financial crisis and the worst December since 1931 and the Great Depression.Yet most economic indicators are benign. Unemployment is an exceptionally low 3.7 percent. Wages are rising. Inflation remains below the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent target. The Fed raised rates a quarter point in December, citing “a very healthy economy.”Given Mr. Stack’s track record last year, I reached out to him this week for his current views. Even though valuations have come down and macroeconomic indicators “have remained remarkably strong,” he said, he’s still defensive and hasn’t changed his bearish allocation. He believes that the worst isn’t over and that the Dow and S&P 500 will soon be down 20 percent from their peaks, retreating into a bear market. (The Nasdaq Composite and the Wilshire 2000 index of small-cap stocks are already there.)And that was before a revenue warning from Apple sent markets into another steep fall on Thursday.“A lesson from history is that the market leads the economy by a lot longer than investors realize,” Mr. Stack said. If the economy is headed toward recession, as the latest stock market declines suggest it may be, “we won’t see the first economic warning signs until the first three to five months” of 2019. Among the leading indicators he’s watching for signs of weakness are consumer confidence, housing starts and unemployment claims.On Thursday, the Institute for Supply Management manufacturing index, a leading indicator of industrial activity, fell sharply. That suggests that “serious cracks” are starting to appear in the economy, Mr. Stack said.Mr. Stack is right that bear markets typically precede recessions by many months: CNBC calculated in 2016 that bear markets since World War II had begun on average about eight months before a recession. That means that if a bear market did begin after major indexes peaked last fall, a recession might not start until June or even later. Even then, recessions are often over before economic data confirms their existence.That’s when bear markets are, in fact, followed by recessions, which often isn’t the case. As the economist Paul Samuelson famously said, “The stock market has forecast nine of the last five recessions.”Since World War II, there have been 13 bear markets. They were followed within a year by a recession just seven times. As a predictor of recessions with just 54 percent accuracy, bear markets are little better than flipping a coin.Indeed, Mr. Stack’s data show that two or more down years in a row are quite rare: There have been only four instances since 1928, suggesting that stocks may well be in positive territory by the end of 2019, even if a bear market does materialize in the meantime.Which is one reason the Wharton economist Jeremy Siegel told me that he’s bullish on the stock market this year. He predicts it could rise between 5 percent and 15 percent, even if there is an economic slowdown.Stocks are much cheaper now than they were before the December sell-off. The ratio between stock prices and projected earnings for companies in the S&P 500 is about 17, down from over 19 a year ago and the lowest in the past five years.[Stocks rose Friday after the release of a strong December jobs report and comments by the chairman of the Federal Reserve that the central bank would be flexible on raising interest rates this year.]Mr. Stack, however, argued that in the event of an economic downturn — or even a significant slowdown — “those projected earnings will go out the window.”“I would not call today’s market undervalued,” he added.Mr. Siegel bases his forecast of a market rally on the belief that the Fed will stop raising short-term interest rates. “I think the Fed got the message from the markets that it should not have hiked in December,” he said.Mr. Stack, too, said he was surprised the Fed raised rates in December. “I think the Fed will stand down and put future rate increases on hold,” he said, “which could stabilize the market, at least for the time being.”But Mr. Stack’s technical indicators are still pointing toward a bear market. He’s also worried about the shaky housing market, with price drops and slowing sales showing up in major cities.“We’re not trying to time the market, but we’re very comfortable with our defensive allocation,” he said. Although he predicted higher volatility a year ago, he was nonetheless surprised by the extremes reached in December, without even “a single hard warning sign of recession on the horizon.”“Can you imagine,” he asked, “how volatile it will be when we do have those warnings?”The stock market’s strong start to the year stalled on Tuesday, amid growing pessimism about the prospects for a deal to defuse trade tensions between China and the United States.The S&P 500, which had enjoyed its best start to a year since 1987 through the end of trading on Friday, ended Tuesday down 1.4 percent, the market’s second-worst loss of the year.Stocks slumped from the outset, and the selling worsened through the day after The Financial Times reported that the Trump administration had rejected an offer from China to hold preparatory talks ahead of high-level trade meetings in Washington later this month.Such advance discussions are thought to be an important step toward cementing an agreement between the world’s two largest economies before March 1. After that date, tariffs on some $200 billion of Chinese goods are scheduled to rise sharply, which would send the trade war into a new and more serious phase.Trade-sensitive tech and industrial shares were the worst performers. Microsoft, Facebook and Google’s parent company, Alphabet, all slumped. Semiconductor makers — much of whose revenue comes from sales in China — tumbled, with Nvidia and Micron dropping more than 5 percent.The major industrial exporters Caterpillar and Boeing fell 3.2 percent and 1.9 percent respectively.The tone from industrial firms that reported earnings on Tuesday did little to improve the mood. Shares of the tool manufacturer Stanley Black & Decker tumbled more than 15 percent after the company offered a disappointing outlook for 2019.“We tried to make it very clear that the economic backdrop is one of slowing growth,” James M. Loree, chief executive of Stanley Black & Decker, said on a conference call with analysts.The trade war seems to be a growing source of weakness for the global economy. On Monday, China reported that its economy grew at its slowest rate, 6.6 percent, since 1990, amid a slowdown of its export sector.The report came the same day as the International Monetary Fund trimmed its forecast for global growth in 2019 to 3.5 percent from 3.7 percent, citing, in part, slowing worldwide trade.Stocks came very close to entering a bear market on Christmas Eve, which was a very bad thing. Just about everybody said so.Yet the bear-market label is based on a dangerously unscientific understanding of stock markets. It is dangerous because the designation itself can set off a negative popular narrative that may, in itself, help to fuel a bigger market decline.What happened in December? By Dec. 24, the S&P 500 had fallen 19.8 percent from its peak of September 2018.That was just short of the “traditional” 20 percent slide that many say defines a bear market. It has been strongly up since then, but still remains down substantially from that peak.This tradition doesn’t amount to much, though. I discovered, through digital search, that the practice of using precise definitions for down markets — denoting a “correction” as a 10 percent decline from a peak and a “bear market” as a 20 percent decline — is only a little over 30 years old. It dates back to the mid-1980s.People have spoken loosely of bear markets for more than a hundred years, but they didn’t generally attach a 20 percent definition to them.You might think that the precise identification of a bear market occurred because that 20 percent threshold is intrinsically important — because, for example, there are many times when stock market declines stop at around 20 percent.But, actually, that is not a frequent occurrence. In this century, since 2000, there have been exactly two S&P 500 declines of 20 percent from the market peak — and both of them continued much further, for a net decline of around 50 percent.The first such decline started in 2000. The S&P 500 peaked on March 24 of that year but by March 12, 2001, it had declined 20 percent, and newspapers duly called the situation a bear market.Sometimes the wording suggested that the market was nearing its bottom. Writers didn’t know the decline was over, but evidently felt comfortable joking about it: “Bear Country Good Territory for Stock Hunting,” one headline said.That lighthearted approach was unfortunate because the S&P 500 turned out to be less than halfway through its decline. Ultimately, from its 2000 peak it dropped 49.1 percent through Oct. 9, 2002, before turning up. In real terms, correcting for inflation, that was more than a 50 percent price drop from peak to trough.Then there was the stock market of the Great Recession. The S&P 500 peaked on Oct. 9, 2007. It became a bear market, having declined over 20 percent, on July 11, 2008.There were lots of bear jokes that July, with suggestions that the start of a bear market signaled the end of a process: “Stop Worrying and Learn to Love the Bear,” was the headline of a Wall Street Journal article then. Still, the market kept going down, and bottomed on March 9, 2009, after losing 56.7 percent of its peak value.Those two episodes tell us something important: The start of a bear market doesn’t mean much. From a historical perspective, it is clear that a 20 percent decline does not predict further market movements with any certainty.That may not have been obvious between 1980 and 1990, when the 20 percent definition of a bear market first became established, because there were then two fairly recent 20 percent declines from S&P 500 peaks that did not precede sharper falls.On March 3, 1982, after dropping 21.1 percent from a Nov. 28, 1980, peak and entering what we would now call bear market territory, the S&P 500 fell only 6 percent further. And after a one-day S&P 500 decline of 20.5 percent on Oct. 19, 1987, the index fell only 0.4 percent further to a trough on Dec. 4, 1987.In short, the mere diagnosis of a bear market doesn’t seem to carry much weight for forecasting future price drops.Yet let’s not dismiss the effects of a bear market declaration too soon. Simply by announcing that we have entered a bear market and repeating that claim in the echo chamber of social media, the designation itself might create psychological unease that could make for market volatility.Popular labels carry emotional content. If the declarations of bear markets are charged with negativity, bull markets are fraught with symbolic and patriotic feelings.Consider the “Charging Bull” sculpture, symbolizing the bull market vigor of the financial markets, by Arturo Di Modica. It was first installed in 1989 in the aftermath of the 1987 stock market crash, in Bowling Green in the financial district of New York.The initial installation of the bull statue caught the popular imagination. It was the second time, according to Google Ngrams, that “bull” and “bear” were really widely used (the first time being in the boom of the 1920s and the 1929 crash).The statue may be the second most famous sculpture in New York, after the Statue of Liberty, and tourists flock to take selfies with it. It is a symbol of much more than a market direction. According to the sculptor, the statue also symbolizes  “the strength and power of the American people.” It has become an icon of national identity, patriotism and animal spirits.By the same token, the notion that a bear market may be around the corner can be profoundly disruptive. The near-miss diagnosis of a “bear market” on Christmas Eve 2018 seemed to have struck fear and disorientation in many investors, like an inconclusive lab test for a dread disease, making people vulnerable to more pessimistic feelings.Of course, some people may have interpreted the near miss as a clean bill of health, perhaps even a buying opportunity, depending on circumstances and on the narratives they choose to believe.Narratives matter in the stock market, which is, in many ways, a social-psychological barometer. Whether people are exulting about a bull market or running from a bear, volatile emotions are involved. In the next round in the stock market, we will see who outnumbers whom.Corporate warnings about China’s sluggish economy hit stocks on Monday as the battle between the world’s largest economies over trade and technology continued to weigh on the outlook for growth and profits.The warnings, which came from the chipmaker Nvidia and the bulldozer builder Caterpillar, concerned very different sectors of China’s economy. But the message was nearly the same, as was the sharp tumble in shares, which made them the two worst performing stocks in the S&P 500. The broad index dropped almost 0.8 percent on Monday.Nvidia, which makes technology that allows computers to quickly render graphics for games, cut its expectations for revenue in the fourth quarter by roughly half a billion dollars, to $2.2 billion, sending its shares down nearly 14 percent. The Santa Clara, Calif., company cited “deteriorating macroeconomic conditions, particularly in China,” for hampering demand for such graphics-processing chips.Shares of other chipmakers — which derive large chunks of their revenue from sales in China — fell in sympathy with Nvidia. Advanced Micro Devices tumbled almost 8 percent, helping to make the information technology sector one of the worst-performing parts of the S&P 500 on Monday.Meanwhile, Caterpillar, which builds bulldozers, excavators and dump trucks, was down 9 percent after the quarterly profit it reported on Monday fell short of the expectations of Wall Street analysts.The Deerfield, Ill., industrial giant also undershot analyst expectations for its full-year profit forecast. The company said it now expected construction equipment sales in China — somewhere between 10 percent and 15 percent of all of the companies’ construction sales — to be flat in 2019.The health of the Chinese economy, which is the world’s second largest, has emerged as a key risk to the American stock market in 2019. Last year China grew at its slowest pace in 28 years, as it continues shift away from the model that drove the country’s economic rise in recent decades, focusing on industrial exports. It has pushed toward a model that relies more on consumer spending.That transition has been made even more difficult by the eruption of a tariff war with the United States under President Trump. Originally that fight was centered on cutting China’s longstanding trade surplus with the United States, but has more recently expanded to tough-to-resolve issues around determining technological dominance, which would be even more difficult to solve anytime soon.The re-emergence of investor concerns around China have helped cool what was a sizzling start to the year for the American stock market. Through the first three weeks of the year, the S&P was up 6.5 percent, the index’s best start since 1987. It remains up more than 5 percent.Get the DealBook newsletter to make sense of major business and policy headlines — and the power-brokers who shape them.__________The trade war didn’t seem to discourage Chinese companies from listing their shares on American exchanges last year. In fact, it might have brought more Chinese companies to Wall Street.Tencent Music’s trading debut on the New York Stock Exchange in December capped a wave of Chinese companies going public in the United States. In total, 33 Chinese firms raised $9.2 billion through initial public offerings on American exchanges — up 140 percent from 2017 and the highest level since 2014, according to Dealogic.Of course, 2014 comes with an asterisk of sorts. Alibaba went public in September that year, raising $25 billion. Subtract the value of Alibaba’s offering and Chinese firms raised just $3 billion that year.Last year, however, offerings from Chinese firms dominated the United States market for initial public offerings. The three largest I.P.O.s by market value were Chinese companies. And Chinese firms accounted for four of the 10 largest such offerings in 2018 ranked by amount raised on American exchanges, the most of any country, including the United States, according to Dealogic.Why list in America?American exchanges offer prestige and a broader investor base that Chinese entrepreneurs can find attractive. The United States also offers a quicker route to the public markets. While Chinese regulators have taken steps to reduce the long wait, it still takes 18 months or longer for shares to begin trading from the time a company files to go public. That compares with just 42 days to list in the United States, according to Dealogic.But the trade war may also have been a factor.A slowing Chinese economy and escalating trade tensions dragged down markets in Hong Kong and China before stocks in the United States turned seriously wobbly. At their lows in late October, the Hang Seng stock index and the benchmark stock indexes in Shenzhen and Shanghai were down 15 percent to 35 percent for the year. By comparison, the S & P 500 was still up 2.5 percent at that point, making it far more attractive for offerings.The colossal disarray over the British government’s plans to leave the European Union comes at an awkward moment for global financial markets.How can anyone in New York hope to make sense of the mess in London when the government in Washington is closed one day, set to re-open the next and in danger of shutting down again soon?Yet financial markets put a price on just about anything, and they don’t stop functioning when governments do. Even when a projected outcome is gruesome or improbable, some traders will try to make a wager on it. Bets on “Brexit” — Britain’s exit from the European Union — and the effects of the government shutdown in this country are well underway.Whether these bets are humane or prudent is another question. But the shifting odds on Brexit have moved stock, bond and foreign exchange markets, especially in the past two weeks, as the government of Prime Minister Theresa May has flirted with disaster.Events in London have grabbed strategists’ attention. In a note to clients on Jan. 16, Capital Economics, a research group in London, said it placed a 70 percent probability on this broad outcome: that Britain finds a way to “fudge and delay” its exit from the European Union past the current March 29 deadline.If that delay becomes certain, or just more likely than it seems now, Capital Economics said, the value of the British pound could be expected to rise. At the same time, British stocks, which have generally lagged behind the S&P 500 since the Brexit referendum in 2016, would probably surge, Capital Economics said.Abrupt movements in foreign exchange markets have already occurred. The pound fell sharply on Jan. 15, when Parliament dealt Mrs. May a crushing defeat. By the largest margin ever for a major issue, lawmakers rejected the Brexit agreement she had spent months negotiating with the European Union.But the next day Mrs. May survived a no-confidence vote, not by acclamation but by default: The opposition Labour Party simply could not muster enough votes to defeat her. She has soldiered on, as the Brexit deadline draws ever closer. Not incidentally, the pound has regained some of its lost ground.March 29 remains a meaningful deadline. One way or another, Britain is scheduled to leave the European Union then. Yet lawmakers and Mrs. May’s government have been unable to agree on a course of action. To continue deliberating about what to do, they would need to ask the bloc for an extension, like a team of unruly students who cannot even agree on a topic as a term-paper deadline approaches.Yet a delay is what most betting people think will happen, according to Capital Economics, which believes a negotiated settlement will, eventually, mitigate much of the harm that could be inflicted by an abrupt exit. This expectation is reflected in current stock, bond and currency prices, Capital Economics said.Bettors have not ruled out a much more disruptive scenario that is viewed as a low-probability event — somewhere below 20 percent but above zero. That is Britain’s exit on March 29 without any negotiated agreement at all.What would that mean? The Bank of England has boiled the probable effects down in straightforward and troubling terms. In a November report it projected that such a “no deal Brexit” would be a major shock that could subtract more than 10 percent from Britain’s gross domestic product.Unemployment would soar, inflation would rise and Britain would fall into a serious recession, the central bank said. While the sun set on the British Empire long ago, the fallout of a calamity in Britain for the European Union, the global markets and the worldwide economy, would be significant, if less easily measured.Goldman Sachs is less sanguine than rank-and-file bettors: In a report this month, it placed the odds that Brexit would be delayed at only 50-50. And, it said, “the distribution of risks around Brexit outcomes is widening.”Goldman placed a 40 percent probability on the chance that Britain, in the end, would not leave the European Union at all, which would be accomplished through another referendum repudiating the original vote. The bank assigned a 10 percent probability to a no-deal Brexit on March 29, with potentially calamitous consequences.For investors in the United States, Goldman produced a list of companies in the S&P 500 that derive considerable revenue from Britain. Buying shares of these stocks, or betting against them by shorting them, might be a handy way of using the American stock market to place a Brexit wager. The companies include Newmont Mining; PPL, a utility; and three financial services companies: Affiliated Managers; Willis, Towers, Watson; and Invesco.Corporations active in Britain have been hedging against Brexit for months, of course, by shifting parts of their operations to places deemed more stable.The latest to announce a move is Dyson, the appliances company privately held by James Dyson, an outspoken Brexit advocate. The company said this week that it would move its headquarters to Singapore. In an article in The Telegraph, Mr. Dyson assured his countrymen that he was making this move because of Asia’s expanding place in the company’s global operations, not because of Brexit.Whatever his reasons, most British residents can’t hedge against Brexit by relocating part of their households to another country. Instead, if the probability of a wrenching separation from Europe appeared to be rising, prudent people might take the steps that anyone does when a possible disaster looms: hoarding necessities like food, water and medicine; stocking up on cash and fuel; retreating to safer ground, if any can be found.Such measures may be individual lifesavers, but when many people take them at once, they may make a crisis more severe, especially when confidence in government is ebbing.Global markets shudder when panics start, which is why bets on potential crises are risky. And if this is true for Brexit, what can we say about the longest government shutdown in United States history?Financial markets have largely taken the shutdown, and the news Friday of a deal to re-open the government for three weeks, in stride. Despite the pain inflicted on government workers and those who depend on them, economists have generally concluded that the effects will be transitory.But even if a permanent funding agreement is reached, political tensions in the United States remain high, amid a series of simmering crises that could easily unnerve markets. These include the trade conflict between the United States and China and America’s fraying relations with allies like Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Japan and Mexico.Market calculations shift swiftly, and hedging against losses on multiple fronts could quickly become the order of the day.For mutual-fund investors, the fourth quarter of 2018 was a hailstorm — a stinging deluge in which nearly every sort of investment seemed to get plunked.Yet several top-performing funds managed to find refuge in far-flung corners of the market, like Latin American companies, real estate investment trusts and dividend-paying stocks.T. Rowe Price Latin America Verena E. Wachnitz, portfolio manager of the T. Rowe Price Latin America Fund, was spared the fourth quarter’s party of pain because of where she invests: Latin America was one of the few major markets that rose late last year.Brazil accounted for much of that gain. It endured a severe recession in 2015 and 2016 and anemic growth in 2017. But a stronger recovery began last year, and the Brazilian Bovespa stock index gained 15 percent in 2018.Brazil is Latin America’s biggest economy, and its stocks account for more than 60 percent of the MSCI Emerging Markets Latin America index, so Ms. Wachnitz keeps a big chunk of her shareholders’ money there.“Brazil has a lot of high-quality companies,” she said. “Whatever happens there is key for the region.” Seven of her fund’s top 10 holdings are Brazilian, including two banks, Itaú Unibanco and Banco Bradesco, and an apparel retailer, Lojas Renner.The banks, two of Brazil’s heftiest, are profiting as consumers start to borrow and spend more with the recovery, Ms. Wachnitz said.Lojas Renner likewise stands to gain from a surge in consumer spending. “They’re really going into the digital age, and the consumer experience improves every year,” she said. “Now you can check out directly with employees who have hand-held devices.”Ms. Wachnitz has also benefited from where she chose not to invest: She shied from Mexico, because of concerns about how the policies of its new government might affect the profitability of its companies. Mexican shares make up only 14.6 percent of her fund, compared with 21.6 percent of the index. The S&P BMV IPC, a leading Mexico stock index, lost 15.27 percent last quarter.“I’m not that worried about trade and Trump,” she said. “The new trade agreement is moving forward. But policymaking is deteriorating in Mexico, with a more populist, left-wing type of government.”Ms. Wachnitz’s fund, with a net expense ratio of 1.29 percent, returned 6.01 percent in the fourth quarter, compared with a loss of 13.52 percent, including dividends, for the S&P 500. The quarter’s punishments weren’t limited to the S&P 500 and Mexico: Nearly every stock-market sector tracked by Morningstar recorded a loss.MFS Diversified IncomeMFS Diversified Income didn’t manage a gain in the fourth quarter: It lost 3.79 percent. But it still outpaced all but a few competitors by spreading its bets around on income-producing securities. The fund, with an expense ratio of 0.99 percent, aims to “out-yield the equity market but outgrow the bond market and hopefully do so with less volatility,” said Robert M. Almeida, its lead portfolio manager. To do this, it owns both stocks and bonds.On the stock side, Mr. Almeida divides his shareholders’ money among real estate investment trusts and dividend payers and, on the bond side, investment-grade, high-yield and emerging-market debt.His starting point is an allocation of 20 percent of the fund’s assets to each of these asset classes — R.E.I.T.s, dividend payers and investment-grade bonds — as well as 25 percent to high-yield bonds and 15 percent to emerging-markets bonds. He then tweaks the precise weight of each by consulting with MFS’s other portfolio managers and its analysts. “In the fourth quarter, we were overweight emerging-market debt and R.E.I.T.s and underweight high-yield debt and global dividend-paying stocks,” he said.Those emerging-markets bonds represent a wager that the finances of some of the developing world’s governments are safer than the markets may appreciate. Mr. Almeida said many investors fixate on the economic trouble spots in the emerging world, like recently Venezuela and Turkey.“What doesn’t get talked about is Chile and Peru, which are fundamentally strong countries. I don’t think of them as high risk. High-yield debt is risk. There, you’re lending to the lower-quality end of the U.S. corporate market, which is going to have to refinance a lot of debt at higher rates over the next two to three years.”Mr. Almeida said his R.E.I.T. bet stemmed partly from a presentation made by Richard R. Gable, portfolio manager of the MFS Global Real Estate Fund. “Rick was saying the R.E.I.T. sector was the cheapest it’d been, relative to financials and the rest of the equity market, in years,” he said.Among R.E.I.T.s, Mr. Almeida said, MFS prefers those “with properties that are really hard to replicate.” His fund’s top real estate holdings include the Simon Property Group, the United States’ largest shopping-mall owner, and AvalonBay Communities, an apartment owner that is strong in coastal urban markets.American Funds College 2024 and College 2027 The American Funds College 2024 Fund and College 2027 Fund also buy both stocks and bonds. The two target-date college funds don’t invest directly in those securities but do so through other funds in the American family, which is managed by the Capital Group. Both college funds, for example, hold shares of the American Mutual Fund and the Bond Fund of America, which have been part of the American lineup for decades.The college funds are investment options in CollegeAmerica, a 529 college-savings plan sponsored by the state of Virginia. (That “529” refers to a provision of the United States Internal Revenue Code, and anyone can invest in the funds, not just Virginians, though the tax benefits may differ for people in other states.) The 2024 fund lost 1.27 percent in the fourth quarter, while the 2027 fund lost 3.26 percent. The 2024 fund has an expense ratio of 0.73 percent, while the 2027 has one of 0.8 percent.Wesley K.-S. Phoa, principal investment officer for American Funds’ target-date college funds series, said the funds’ bond investments didn’t carry excessive credit risk or unexpected correlations with the stock market, while the stock investments emphasized sturdiness, not sizzle. “We’ve picked stock funds that focus on solid blue-chip dividend payers, and that has delivered the resilience we hoped it would,” he said.Mr. Phoa said college funds present an unusual asset-allocation challenge in that investors — often parents — are seeking the savings growth that stocks can bring but they typically have only about 15 years to achieve that. That gives them less time to ride out down markets, like the fourth quarter’s thumping.“Most parents make steady modest contributions, and a lot start when their kids are 6 or 7,” he said. “When you’re putting in modest amounts, you want to get as much growth as you can. So we’re pretty growth oriented for a young beneficiary. But once you get within a couple of years in college enrollment, that’s the last thing you want. So at this stage, we’re invested very conservatively.”For the 2024 fund, whose intended beneficiaries are now 13 to 15 years old, that translates to about 68 percent bonds, 26 percent stocks and 6 percent cash. For the 2027 fund, whose intended beneficiaries are now 10 to 12, that translates to 54 percent bonds, 41 percent stocks and 5 percent cash.Mr. Phoa said he has recently gained a new appreciation of the stresses his clients face, because his own daughter is 16 and thinking about college. “Once you get within a couple of years in college enrollment, the last thing you want to discuss is what’s happening in the 529 account.”One by one, the concerns that have hung over the stock market have faded. Fears that the United States economy would dip into a recession this year have eased. The Federal Reserve seems to be finished raising interest rates for the foreseeable future, and optimism has increased that the United States and China could end their trade war.But if the January snap back (it was the best start to a year for stocks in decades, after the worst December for stocks in an even longer period) is to sustain itself, big technology companies likely will have to lead the way. So far this year, they have not done that. For much of the past decade, the fate of the stock market has been tied to the performance of a handful of the largest tech companies: Amazon, Apple, Alphabet, Facebook, Microsoft and Netflix led the market from one record to the next.By the end of August, their sway over the direction of the S&P 500 exceeded all but two of the index’s 11 sector groupings. As the index pushed to a record high last summer, the rise in those six companies’ shares accounted for half of its gain. They led on the way down too, dragging the broader market lower over the final three months of 2018 and nearly ending the longest bull market on record.So it’s notable, then, that as the S&P 500 rallied nearly 8 percent in January, the big technology stocks accounted for just 17 percent of the benchmark’s rise, according to data from Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst for S&P Dow Jones Indices. What happened? The companies have faced a fundamental question since late last year: Could they continue to pull in new users and generate more sales in a slowing global economy? Sales growth had begun to slow in the second half of 2018 and earnings updates in January haven’t fully resolved investors’ concerns about their trajectory. “This is the first quarter in my memory that technology has on the whole had worse metrics than the S&P 500,” said Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute, referring to the earnings and revenue growth rate of big technology companies.After Apple warned of diminishing demand for new iPhones in China earlier this year, its forecast for the current quarter wasn’t as dire as many on Wall Street had feared. The stock has gained 7.7 percent since then. Still, the iPhone maker reported a 15 percent drop in revenue, including a 27 percent decline in China, and its results indicated a difficult road ahead. Its stock remains nearly 30 percent below its peak.Amazon reported record profits and revenue. But its shares were down 5.4 percent Friday in part because revenue from online shopping slowed and the growth of Prime memberships appeared to have plateaued.Microsoft shares have fallen 3.4 percent since it reported on Wednesday. Revenue at the software giant has surged in recent years as its bet on cloud computing has paid off, but there were continued signs that that acceleration could be tapering off.Facebook, whose shares were the most battered among the big tech companies last year, was perhaps the bright spot this earnings season. Despite a string of scandals, the social network generated record revenue and profit last year. Its shares have jumped 10.5 percent since Wednesday.Netflix also said revenue would grow more slowly this quarter. Its stock is down almost 3.8 percent since it reported on Jan. 17.There is a big caveat to all the hand-wringing about slowing growth: All five companies still generate huge revenue. And should Beijing and Washington reach an agreement in the trade war, sales could pick up if the global economy, particularly China’s, begins to gain speed. “There was real concern that tech was the canary in the coal mine of what would be a very dark 2019,” said Daniel Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities covering technology companies. “Thus far a lot of those fears are proving overblown. That could set the stage for tech to make new highs this year, depending on what happens with China.”Good Monday morning. Want this by email?

Weak Chinese consumer demand blew a $9 billion hole in Apple’s latest quarterly sales. Nvidia warned last month that its revenue would come in 20 percent below expectations. Intel’s January financials didn’t meet forecasts. And Samsung’s sales plunged 10 percent in the fourth quarter.Behind the trend: semiconductors. “China, smartphones, Bitcoin and cloud computing have been among the major drivers of the long tech boom, which in turn has powered the global economy for the last decade. The ingredient common to all of these sectors is computer chips, which form the brains of devices and whose ubiquity means they provide early signals about changes in supply and demand,” write David Streitfeld and Don Clark of the NYT. With chip manufacturers predicting slumping sales for 2019, tech more generally could be in line for a slowdown.Sound familiar? “The notion that a chip dip could lead to a general downturn evokes memories of 2000, when one day tech had an unlimited future and the next it was crashing in what became known as the dot-com bust,” write Mr. Streitfeld and Mr. Clark.And the industry no longer carries the stock market. For years, stock market performance have been tied to the fortunes of the largest tech companies: Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Microsoft and Netflix. As the S&P 500 pushed to a record high last summer, rises in those six companies’ share prices accounted for half of its gain. But when the index rallied nearly 8 percent in January, Stephen Grocer writes, their stocks accounted for just 17 percent of the rise.Lloyd Blankfein may pay for Goldman’s links to 1MDBThe former Goldman Sachs C.E.O. — as well as his successor, David Solomon, and other top executives — may have to give back some compensation from 2018, depending on the findings of an investigation into the firm’s work with the scandal-ridden Malaysian investment fund 1MDB.The announcement, made in a regulatory filing on Friday, shows how seriously Goldman is treating any role it may have had in fraud committed at 1MDB. Prosecutors in the U.S. and Malaysia are leading criminal investigations into 1MDB, and a former top deal maker at the firm has pleaded guilty to bribery, conspiracy and money laundering charges. Goldman says it’s cooperating with authorities.The WSJ calculates that Mr. Blankfein, who stepped down as chief executive of Goldman last year, might lose millions. And though Mr. Solomon wasn’t a top-ranking Goldman executive at the time, he could see some of his $23 million pay for last year clawed back as well. (Gary Cohn, who was Goldman’s No. 2 during the 1MDB work and received a lump payout when he left the firm in 2017, wouldn’t be affected.)In lighter Goldman news: Mr. Solomon, whose side hustle is DJing as DJ D-Sol, has released his second single, “Feel Alive.”Deutsche Bank refused Trump a loan in 2016For two decades, Deutsche Bank was the only major lender to give Donald Trump money, helping him finance his real estate operations. But when he sought a loan in early 2016 to help pay for a Scottish golf course — all while running for president — the German lender said no.More from David Enrich, Jesse Drucker and Ben Protess of the NYT:Senior officials at the bank, including its future chief executive, believed that Mr. Trump’s divisive candidacy made such a loan too risky, the people said. Among their concerns was that if Mr. Trump won the election and then defaulted, Deutsche Bank would have to choose between not collecting on the debt or seizing the assets of the president of the United States.What’s next: Expect House Democrats to include this in their investigation of Mr. Trump’s finances.More Deutsche Bank news: The lender reportedly scrambled to rid itself of a $600 million loan made to VTB, a Russian state-owned bank, in late 2016 as the German bank sought to reduce its exposure to Russian entities.How an S.U.V. became a Brexit warning signThe automaker Nissan confirmed yesterday that it had abandoned plans to build its new X-Trail sport utility vehicle in Britain and said that the car would be produced solely in Japan. It’s a blow for the British economy, and a clear signal that uncertainty over Britain’s withdrawal from the E.U. is weighing on corporate minds.A clear culprit. “The continued uncertainty around the U.K.’s future relationship with the E.U. is not helping companies like ours to plan for the future,” Nissan’s Europe chairman, Gianluca de Ficchy, said in a statement. Greg Clark, Britain’s business secretary, told the FT that it was “a warning sign” about how much damage could be caused by a no-deal Brexit.Nissan is not alone. British C.F.O.s say that Brexit is currently the largest threat to their businesses. Some 78 percent of those surveyed said that the business environment in the nation would deteriorate if Britain left the E.U.What now? Prime Minister Theresa May is set to return to Brussels in the coming days in an attempt to redraft her Brexit deal. In the meantime, Bloomberg reports that she “will launch a new government working group intended to unite the feuding pro- and anti-Brexit factions” in her party.The oil field that made American oil greatThe U.S. is now the top oil producer in the world, able to sway petroleum prices and breezily sanction Iran and Venezuela. The reason, as Cliff Krauss of the NYT notes: the Permian Basin, the heart of America’s shale industry.How big is it? It covers the same area as South Dakota, and produces four million barrels of oil a day — making it a bigger generator of oil than any member of OPEC other than Iraq and Saudi Arabia.What makes it special? It’s huge and rich in oil rather than in less-valuable natural gas. And it’s close to refineries on the Gulf of Mexico.What could go wrong? Oil companies there might pump too much, drawing ire from OPEC. As Scott Sheffield, the chairman of Pioneer Natural Resources, told the NYT: “You could have another price war.” And U.S. sanctions on Venezuelan crude could hurt American refineries, which can’t rely solely on the Permian.Hungry for ‘executive time’ in your calendar? Study Trump’s schedule and weepAxios has published almost three months of President Trump’s schedules after they were leaked, reportedly by somebody in the White House. Some highlights:• “Trump has spent around 60 percent of his scheduled time over the past three months in unstructured ‘Executive Time.’ ”• “He spends his mornings in the residence, watching TV, reading the papers, and responding to what he sees and reads by phoning aides, members of Congress, friends, administration officials and informal advisers,” six people with direct knowledge of his schedule told Axios.• “Trump’s first meeting of the day — usually around 11 or 11:30 a.m. — is often an intelligence briefing or a 30-minute meeting with the chief of staff.”• “The president sometimes has meetings during Executive Time that he doesn’t want most West Wing staff to know about for fear of leaks. And his mornings sometimes include calls with heads of state, political meetings and meetings with counsel in the residence, which aren’t captured on these schedules.”Bonus: Axios also compared the schedules with those of Mr. Trump’s predecessors. He appears to share most in common with Bill Clinton’s early days in office.2019’s Super Bowl ads: nostalgia, wokeness and depressing techO.K., so the game itself may have been a slog to watch, and the halftime show was forgettable. But for those of you who came for the ads, here are the themes that dominated — to the tune of $5.2 million per 30 seconds of airtime.The ’90s: Stella Artois featured Carrie Bradshaw from “Sex and the City” and the Dude from “The Big Lebowski.” Doritos put the Backstreet Boys front and center.Social consciousness: The dating app Bumble hired Serena Williams to urge women to “make the first move” in all parts of their lives. And Budweiser touted renewable energy in an ad featuring a cute dog.The downsides of tech: Olay’s spot showed the actress Sarah Michelle Gellar struggling to save herself from a home intruder when her phone’s facial-recognition software fails. An ad for Pringles featured a smart speaker bemoaning its existence. And TurboTax built an ad around a robot boy craving a late-night snack.Revolving doorApple reportedly removed Bill Stasior as the head of its Siri virtual assistant unit, though he remains at the company.Gianni Infantino is poised to win a second term as president of FIFA, soccer’s global governing body.SoftBank of Japan hired Sarah Lubman, most recently a partner at the Brunswick Group, as a partner in corporate communications.The speed readDeals• Spotify is said to be in talks to buy the podcasting company Gimlet Media.

So have pension funds and mutual funds, as well as a whole other category of investors — nonprofit groups, endowments, private equity firms and personal trusts. The stock market is off to its best start since 1987, but these investors are expected to dump hundreds of billions of dollars of shares this year.So who is pushing prices higher? In part, the companies themselves. American corporations flush with cash from last year’s tax cuts and a growing economy are buying back their own shares at an extraordinary clip. They have good reason: Buybacks allow them to return cash to shareholders, burnish key measures of financial performance and goose their share prices.The surge in buybacks reflects a fundamental shift in how the market is operating, cementing the position of corporations as the single largest source of demand for American stocks. The binge has helped sustain a bull market approaching its 10th birthday, even in the face of political, international and economic uncertainty. Since the market rally began in March 2009, the S&P 500 has risen more than 300 percent as the United States recovered from the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. But few expect those kinds of gains over the next decade. Facing the prospect of a period of relatively low returns — or even a bear market for stocks — many investors are eager to protect their gains or to find more appealing investments, like emerging markets and corporate bonds, outside the American stock market. “There’s no reason to be a hog,” said Rich Robben, interim chief investment officer of the Kentucky Retirement Systems, which manages more than $17 billion in the state’s retirement and insurance funds. “We’ve all eaten at the public equity trough very well for 10 years now. And we felt it was just time to reduce that exposure a bit.”Mr. Robben said his pension fund, which pays benefits to more than 100,000 retired state and county workers, has been cutting its stake in the domestic stock market for 18 months. Such prudence paid off late last year, when concerns about a sluggish global economy, rising interest rates and slowing corporate profits hit the market. The S&P 500 fell 14 percent in the fourth quarter, and 9 percent in December alone. That was the worst monthly performance since February 2009, and badly shook investor confidence. Since the worst of the sell-off, on Dec. 24, the S&P 500 is up roughly 19 percent. But data show that many investors remain nervous: In every week this year, money has flowed out of domestic stock market mutual funds and exchange-traded funds — as much as $15 billion in the last week of January, according to EPFR Global, which tracks flows into and out of funds. These investors, overwhelmingly individuals, have moved money into bonds and cash. Henry Crutcher has missed a bit of the rebound. Mr. Crutcher, a 44-year-old software company owner in Atlanta, saw December’s crack in the stock market as a buying opportunity and moved roughly 10 percent of his portfolio from cash into a Russell 2000 exchange-traded fund. After enjoying a couple weeks of rising stock prices, he sold it, missing much of the roughly 10 percent of additional gains that have come since mid-January.“Right now I’m partially invested,” Mr. Crutcher said. “I’m not totally sitting on the sidelines. But I’m more on the sidelines than I think I should be.”Survey data suggests portfolio managers at many mutual funds and hedge funds have also been skittish about chasing the market higher. A survey of global fund managers by Bank of America Merrill Lynch this month reported that those holding more money in cash than usual outnumbered their stock-friendly counterparts by 44 percentage points — the biggest margin since January 2009. Such statistics suggest that many investors failed to capitalize on the sharp snapback in stocks early this year. “The speed of the rally is uncomfortable,” said Michael Hartnett, chief investment strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. “To turn from a seller to a buyer in a week is, again, psychologically very tough for people.”Corporations, however, don’t seem to be experiencing such angst. In the fourth quarter last year, American companies bought an estimated $240 billion of their own shares, according to an analysis by the Goldman Sachs team that handles stock buybacks for major companies. That’s nearly 60 percent higher than during the same period in 2017. More buybacks are coming. The Union Pacific railroad has bought nearly $32 billion in its own shares since 2007, and this month authorized buying over $20 billion more. The tech equipment giant Cisco has spent roughly $20 billion on buybacks in the past year, and has authorizations to spend another $24 billion. And Bank of America, which planned to buy $20 billion of its own shares by the end of June, just added $2.5 billion on top of that, the bank said this month.Besides returning cash to shareholders, buybacks offer companies two crucial benefits. They increase demand for a stock, helping to prop up share prices. Buybacks also improve a key gauge of profitability closely tracked by investors and analysts: When a company buys back shares, the same profits are spread over the smaller number of shares still outstanding, improving their earnings-per-share number. So far this year, companies have announced plans to repurchase a total of more than $190 billion of their own shares. That is only slightly behind last year’s pace of buyback announcements. And last year was a record for buybacks, as companies, in part thanks to the Trump administration’s tax cut, gobbled $910 billion of their shares, according to an analysis by Goldman Sachs. Before the early 1980s, buying shares with corporate money was considered a legal gray area because it might open a company up to charges of manipulating its share price. In 1982, the Securities and Exchange Commission adopted a rule that allowed share repurchases, provided they followed certain rules.Since then, stock buybacks have largely replaced dividends as companies’ preferred way to return to shareholders the cash they can’t spend productively. Shareholders like buybacks because they reduce the numbers of shares outstanding, which results in each remaining share being worth a bigger slice of the company. Taxes on buybacks can also be deferred until investors sell the shares, which are then taxed as capital gains. While share buybacks tend to increase companies’ share prices, critics blame them for stymieing corporate investment, hiring and wages. They argue that when a company spends its cash on buybacks, it leaves less money available for long-term capital spending and wages. Supporters of buybacks argue, however, that companies won’t make new investments or increase hiring if they don’t see a profitable reason to do so. They contend that banning buybacks would simply result in higher dividend payments and corporate cash holdings or a surge in mergers and acquisitions. Senators Chuck Schumer, a Democrat from New York, and Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont, said this month that they planned to introduce legislation that would limit buybacks for companies that did not pay their workers at least a $15 an hour, among other criteria. Also this month, Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, said he planned to introduce a bill that would change the preferential tax treatment of buybacks, though the details of such an approach remain unclear. But even if such proposals were enacted — and few Republicans have voiced support for Mr. Rubio’s idea — it’s not clear that they would derail the stock market’s ever-higher march. A number of other factors — most notably the Federal Reserve’s abrupt turn away from its clockwork pattern of interest-rate increases — have combined to restore confidence since the brutal sell-off that left the S&P 500 down nearly 20 percent for the year on Christmas Eve.The arrival of a solid, if unspectacular, batch of fourth-quarter earnings reports also quelled some investors’ fears about the outlook for the global economy and corporate profits.But the persistent flow of corporate money into the stock market has been a pivotal element in its recent rise. “Buybacks are likely the No. 1 cause,” said Brian Reynolds, an analyst at Canaccord Genuity, a Canadian asset management and brokerage firm. Buybacks’ importance to the rally means any legislative push that results in less activity could act as a headwind to stocks, said Michael Purves, chief global strategist at the brokerage firm Weeden & Company. But if such changes don’t gain a foothold, corporate buying will most likely remain a cornerstone of the stock market in the coming years. This year alone, Goldman Sachs analysts estimated, corporations will be by far the largest buyer of shares, with net purchases of $700 billion. Traditional investors like mutual funds, pensions, endowments and individuals are expected to be net sellers, parting with roughly $400 billion in shares. SAN FRANCISCO — Slack, a workplace messaging company, said Monday that it had confidentially filed paperwork for an initial public offering, joining the growing number of technology start-ups heading to the stock market.Slack, which is based in San Francisco, gave no details about the offering’s timing and said it was awaiting a standard review of its paperwork by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The move was expected given that Slack’s chief executive, Stewart Butterfield, had long indicated that he planned to take the company public. Slack recently hired Goldman Sachs to lead the offering.Slack’s confidential filing comes amid a rush by privately held companies to go public this year. Many of these start-ups, which have been highly valued by private investors, are part of a generation of technology companies known as unicorns. Public share sales by the companies are expected to create a bonanza of riches in Silicon Valley for entrepreneurs and venture capital investors.In December, the ride-hailing companies Uber and Lyft filed confidential paperwork for their own public offerings. Their efforts stalled temporarily last month when a government shutdown hampered the S.E.C.’s ability to review the companies’ registration documents. Other tech companies expected to go public this year include the online scrapbooking firm Pinterest.Slack declined to comment beyond its statement about the confidential filing.There is likely to be a strong demand for Slack stock. The company was valued at $7.1 billion by private investors last year, but in recent weeks investment firms have offered to buy its shares at a price that values Slack at $13 billion, according to a person with knowledge of the details who was not authorized to speak publicly.Slack also plans an unusual form of public offering called a direct listing, the person added. Unlike most I.P.O.s, in which firms sell stock to public market investors in advance, direct listings let a company begin trading its shares on an exchange without raising new funds. Spotify, a provider of streaming music, went public in 2018 in a direct listing, paving the way for other high-profile start-ups to follow.With a direct listing, shareholders can also sell their stock immediately after the public offering, instead of waiting for what is known as a lockup period to expire.Slack has little need for cash. It raised $427 million in new financing in August, a year after raising $250 million. The company has collected a total of more than $1 billion from investors that include the SoftBank Vision Fund, General Atlantic, Dragoneer Investment Group and T. Rowe Price Associates.Mr. Butterfield began Slack out of a gaming start-up, Tiny Speck. While the company’s game products failed to take off, its internal communication tool showed promise. In 2014, the company began selling that communication tool, called Slack.Start-ups quickly adopted Slack, and larger companies followed suit. The company offers free and paid versions of Slack and counts more than 85,000 paying customers, including 65 Fortune 100 companies. Last month, Slack said 10 million people now used its product every day. The company generated more than $350 million in revenue last year, said the person with knowledge of the details.Some companies that have filed to go public have never reached that finish line. Over the last year, a number of high-profile business software companies that took steps to go public were snapped up by a tech giant at the last minute. In November, for example, Qualtrics, an analytics start-up, sold to SAP for $8 billion just days before it was set to ring the opening bell at Nasdaq.Google, Microsoft and Amazon have previously expressed interest in acquiring Slack, but the company has demurred. Now some of them have increasingly begun to compete with the start-up. When Microsoft introduced its own workplace messaging company, Microsoft Teams, in 2016, Slack took out a newspaper ad directed at its new competitor.“We’re genuinely excited to have some competition,” it read.In January, Microsoft announced that 420,000 organizations used its Teams product, including 89 of the Fortune 100.Get the DealBook newsletter to make sense of major business and policy headlines — and the power-brokers who shape them.__________Simultaneous rebounds in the stock and bond markets are sending conflicting signals about the direction of the United States economy.The S&P 500 is off to its best start to a year in nearly a decade, up 11 percent so far on optimism about economic growth in the second half of 2019.Bond investors have taken a more pessimistic view on the economy’s fate. Prices on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note have risen this year, pushing down its yield to 2.69 percent, from 3.23 percent just three months ago. Yields fall when bond prices rise.Stock and bond prices are not supposed to rise and fall in tandem. Historically, when investors fret about the future, they pull money out of stock markets and buy relatively safe United States Treasury securities. This dual stock-bond rally has added to doubts about the current rebound in stock prices.Investors have plenty of cause to be worried about the economy. The trade war between the United States and China has continued to drag on economies across the globe and on corporate earnings. Hopes that the two countries will strike an agreement have increased, but significant differences remain in the talks.Behind the dual rally is the Federal Reserve’s decision last month to pause its interest rate increases. The Fed’s shift has left investors in a familiar situation: an economy that isn’t strong enough to compel the Fed to raise rates but is strong enough for corporate America to keep expanding its bottom line.That is the dynamic that has dominated throughout the post-crisis bull market when stocks marched higher, while bond yields plumbed lows. And with the United States economy expected to grow more than 2.5 percent this year and corporate profits forecast to rise 5 percent, it’s one that could prove supportive of stocks in the coming months.But how long this so-called Goldilocks scenario can persist will depend on the Fed’s plan for rates and the United States-China trade negotiations.Investors have grown increasingly convinced that the Fed will not raise rates this year, and some are wagering that the central bank will even cut rates by the end of 2019. This confidence that rates will remain low has made stock returns more appealing and reduced investors’ anxiety about how higher borrowing costs for companies and consumers would crimp the economy.But it’s far from certain that the Fed will hold steady for all of 2019. Minutes from the Fed’s January policy meeting show a divergence among officials, with “several” saying they believed it would be appropriate to raise rates again later this year “if the economy evolved as they expected.”On the trade front, President Trump has indicated that he is prepared to extend the March 2 deadline for a deal with China, when he has threatened to raise tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods to 25 percent from 10 percent. An extension would avoid the worst outcome for the markets, but the longer the talks go on, the more the trade war will drag on the global economy and corporate earnings.And that would raise doubts about the second-half pickup on which investors seem to be counting.To the Editor:Re “Workers Before Buybacks,” by Chuck Schumer and Bernie Sanders (Op-Ed, Feb. 4), calling for the limitation of corporate stock buybacks:The senators seem to believe that they know how best to allocate capital across our $20 trillion economy. Limiting stock buybacks disincentivizes aspiring entrepreneurs to go public and hinders individual shareholders and retirees from building equity.Management and boards of directors for public companies have a fiduciary obligation to maximize long-term appreciation for their shareholders. This requires a thorough knowledge of the company’s growth, capital needs and stock valuation. Policymakers interfering with this fiduciary obligation undermine the free market, possibly leading to unintended consequences for the investor.As shareholder values fall, stock returns to investors will be noncompetitive, and the spotlight will shine on the leaders of the company that made poor capital allocation decisions. Government policy has no business meddling with capital allocation. Boards should take full responsibility for the decisions that affect their shareholders.French Hill WashingtonThe writer, an Arkansas Republican, is a member of the House Financial Services Committee.Get the DealBook newsletter to make sense of major business and policy headlines — and the power-brokers who shape them.__________Fears of a looming United States recession have subsided, with investors taking comfort that the Federal Reserve will continue to support economic growth.But warning signs keep flashing about the shaky fundamentals of the economy and therefore the stock market. The latest alarm bell is that Wall Street analysts are slicing their forecasts for how much big companies will earn in the months ahead.Halfway through the first quarter of the year, analysts now expect profits of companies in the S&P 500 to decline by 1.7 percent from the same period last year, according to data from John Butters, senior earnings analyst at FactSet.That is a sharp reversal from the start of 2019, when the same analysts predicted that corporate earnings would rise by 3.3 percent compared with the first quarter of 2018. And in October, before the stock markets entered a downward spiral at the end of the year, analysts had anticipated that first-quarter earnings would leap by 6.6 percent.Corporate profits are by no means a perfect proxy for the health of the United States economy, the world’s largest. But they exert heavy influence over the direction of the stock markets.In the first nine months of last year, for example, an unexpected gusher of company earnings — up 20 percent from their previous levels — powered the S&P 500 to record highs. The fat bottom lines allowed investors to look past both the prospect of a trade war between the United States and China and a number of data points that showed large foreign economies, including Japan and Germany, losing steam.Even in the final three months of 2018, as the United States appeared to be skidding into an economic recession, corporate profits leapt higher. Not all companies have disclosed their fourth-quarter results yet, but they are on track to be up 13.3 percent from 2017.It isn’t unusual for analysts to pare back their earnings forecasts over the course of a quarter. Corporate executives offer guidance about how their businesses are performing, and a variety of macroeconomic data helps analysts hone their profit projections. Over the past decade, analysts’ profit forecasts have declined on average by 3.7 percent over the course of a full quarter.On Dec. 31, analysts expected companies in the S&P 500 to earn, on average, $40.21 per share. Today, that estimate is $37.95 — an unusually large 5.6 percent drop, according to FactSet.If companies’ first-quarter performances turn out to be as weak as analysts expect, the United States will be on track for what the financial community calls an earnings recession, which occurs when corporate profits shrink for two straight quarters.That looks increasingly likely to happen in the first half of this year. Analysts expect earnings to rise by just 1.2 percent in the second quarter. That forecast is likely to fall, perhaps into negative territory, as more companies disclose their results and analysts update their forecasting models.The S&P 500 last endured an earnings recession in 2015 and 2016. It was set off in large part by tumbling oil prices, which eroded the profits of energy companies. During that period, a six-year stock market rally stalled, and the S&P 500 twice fell by more than 10 percent.Corporate profits this year were always going to face a difficult comparison with 2018. The combination of a strong United States economy and the newly reduced corporate tax rates led earnings to jump more than 20 percent.But profits are now under pressure on multiple fronts, and there are no new tax cuts to cushion the blow — an ill omen for the stock market, if not the broader economy. Rising costs and a slowing global economy, in particular in China, have caused many S&P 500 companies to reduce their profit outlooks for 2019.That is especially true among technology companies. Analysts expect them to report a nearly 10 percent decline in profits in the first quarter, the biggest decline of any sector in the S&P 500.Much of the blame for the tech sector’s declining fortunes rests with Apple. The company warned in early January that it was seeing diminished demand for new iPhones in China. When it reported earnings, Apple said it expected sales of $55 billion to $59 billion in the current quarter, below analysts’ expectations for $59 billion.Since the end of last year, analysts have cut by nearly 19 percent their estimates for how much Apple will earn in the first three months of the year.Drug company executives faced tough questions from Congress on Tuesday as they attempted to explain why, thanks to high drug prices, per capita spending on pharmaceuticals in the United States is double the average of other advanced countries. For decades, American drug makers have justified these high prices by asserting that the higher profits they generate fund research that accelerates the development of new medicines. Our data shows, however, that these companies spend every penny of their profits on distributions to shareholders in the forms of cash dividends and stock buybacks.Because the greater part of management compensation is linked to stock price, the prime beneficiaries of this abuse of corporate profits are the executives who claim that high drug prices redound to the common good. At the same time, drug giants such as Merck and Pfizer seem to have become focused more on buying companies with successful new drugs rather than developing their own.Congress has been raising alarms over drug prices for years. In 1985, Representative Henry Waxman, a California Democrat who was chairman of the House health subcommittee, accused the pharmaceutical industry of “gouging the American public,” driven by “greed on a massive scale.” But the escalation of drug prices has only gotten worse, as documented in various Senate investigations.Despite their claims, the big American drug companies have not been using profits from high prices to ramp up investment in drug development. Our research shows that for 2008 through 2017, 17 pharmaceutical companies in the S. & P. 500 distributed just over 100 percent of their combined profits to shareholders, $300 billion as buybacks and $290 billion as dividends. These distributions were 12 percent greater than what these companies spent on research and development.With most of their compensation coming from exercising stock options and stock awards, senior executives benefit immensely. We gathered data on the 500 highest-paid executives in the United States from 2008 through 2017. The number who came from the drug industry ranged from 21 (in 2008 and 2011) to 42 (in 2014). The total compensation of those 42 executives averaged about $73 million, compared with an average of an already over-the-top $32 million for all 500 in 2014.A total of 88 percent of the 2014 compensation was based on stock. In 2017, 28 drug executives in the top 500 averaged more than $41 million in total compensation, with 83 percent stock-based. By jacking up product prices and distributing the increased profits to shareholders, executives lift stock prices and their take-home pay.Our research for the Institute for New Economic Thinking demonstrates that these companies, even when they show substantial R. & D. spending on their books, do not have much to show for it. For example, Merck distributed 133 percent of its profits to shareholders from 2008 to 2017, and Pfizer 107 percent. Although both companies recorded large sums spent on R. & D. — Merck $80 billion and Pfizer $81 billion over the decade — these companies generated most of their revenues by acquiring companies with patented drugs on the market, rather than by developing their own new drugs. Since 2001, by our analysis, Pfizer has had significant revenues from only four internally originated and developed products. Since Merck’s merger with Schering-Plough in 2009, it has had only two blockbuster drugs, of which only one was the result of its own research. The public foots the bill for this behavior. Not only do we pay high drug prices, our tax dollars supply more than $30 billion per year for life-sciences research through the National Institutes of Health. Yet, like most American companies, the drug industry claims that its corporations need to pay lower corporate taxes to remain competitive globally. European pharmaceutical companies such as Roche and AstraZeneca, on the other hand, have used the same American drug ecosystem — profits from high drug prices and scientific advances resulting from government research funding — to become leaders in medical innovation. Roche dominates the market for specialty drugs in oncology and immunotherapy, while AstraZeneca has a strong pipeline in the latest phases of development. Merck and Pfizer, in comparison, have fallen seriously behind.Congress should put an end to this madness. The government funds medical research and grants the patents and other intellectual property protections that make the pharmaceutical industry’s products financially viable. It should therefore regulate drug prices. The United States should also redesign executive pay to reward drug company leaders who actually bring new innovations to market, and ban most forms of stock buybacks, which are nothing but a manipulation of the stock market that makes the rich even richer. Reinvesting the hundreds of billions of dollars that American drug companies are squandering on buybacks would be a big step on the path to affordable health care for all.William Lazonick, emeritus professor of economics at the University of Massachusetts, Lowell, is the president of the Academic-Industry Research Network, where Öner Tulum, a postdoctoral fellow at SOAS, University of London, is a senior researcher.

And here’s our email: letters@nytimes.com.Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook, Twitter (@NYTopinion) and Instagram.Once again, the Federal Reserve has upended markets.Investors had been bracing for the Fed to keep raising interest rates and shrinking its vast portfolio of assets, the equivalent of tapping on the brakes of the United States economy. But this year, the central bank has signaled that it was backing off.Much has been written about the stock market’s joyful reaction to the Fed’s altered approach. But the impact was much broader than that. The central bank’s shift cascaded through markets around the world in ways large and small. Here’s a look at the consequences of the Fed’s new tone.StocksThe Fed’s change of heart helped halt and partly reverse December’s brutal stock sell-off. On Dec. 24, the S&P 500 was down nearly 20 percent from its recent high. After the Fed chairman, Jerome Powell, began on Jan. 4 to espouse the virtues of patience and flexibility, the market turned sharply higher. The S&P 500 is now up about 15 percent from its nadir in December. Stocks of companies that are sensitive to changes in interest rates have climbed at especially speedy clips. Shares of homebuilders, for example, are up more than 17 percent since the market low in December. That suggests the Fed’s shift has been a big reason for the market’s recent pop. “I think the Fed’s turnaround has been vital to the recovery that we’ve seen in equity markets,” said Tony Roth, chief investment officer at the wealth management firm Wilmington Trust. BondsIn December, stress started to build in the market for corporate bonds. Investors balked at putting money in anything other than super-safe government bonds. One sign of this was a widening of “credits spreads” — the difference between the relatively low yields on government bonds and the relatively high yields on corporate bonds. Since Jan. 4, when the Fed’s swivel began, those credit spreads have fallen sharply. That is largely because the yields on corporate bonds have declined, while those on government debt have barely budged. A big reason for the drop in corporate bond yields is that investors have greater confidence in the United States economy and the ability of American companies to remain financially healthy.Currencies One way to think about the short-term interest rates that the Fed sets is that they are the rates at which investors — or even people with savings accounts or certificates of deposits — get paid for holding American dollars. When the Fed raises rates, and other central banks don’t, those higher United States rates attract capital from around the world. The influx of money pushes up the value of the dollar relative to other currencies. Last year, as the Fed raised interest rates four times and appeared ready to continue in 2019, the dollar rose about 10 percent relative to the euro and other major currencies. The rising value of the dollar has big implications. It makes American manufactured goods more expensive, and therefore less competitive, on the world market. It depresses the overseas earnings of American companies when they get converted back into dollars. And it reduces the prices of commodities, many of which are priced in dollars on global markets. (All else being equal, if the dollar’s value rises, you need fewer dollars to buy the same barrel of oil or ton of iron ore.) The rise in the value of the dollar, along with a supply glut in the world’s oil market, helped push crude oil prices down by more than 40 percent from October to the end of December.When the Fed signaled that it was backing off further rate increases, that slowed the upward momentum of the dollar. In fact, it appeared to put a ceiling on the dollar’s rise, at least for now. That, in turn, is likely to help American companies and strengthen commodity prices. Crude oil prices are up 16 percent in 2019.Emerging MarketsA weaker dollar is also a boon to emerging markets, whose economies often rely on exporting commodities and borrowing money from foreign investors. The weak dollar helps on both counts. With higher commodity prices, it becomes easier for commodity-producing countries and companies to pay off loans, which foreign investors often require to be repaid in dollars. This is a reversal of the 2018 trend, in which the strong dollar provoked a run on emerging markets like Turkey and Argentina, causing the value of their currencies to drop. Money now is flooding back to those developing economies, propelling stock markets in Turkey, Russia and Brazil.The FutureThe question is how durable this relief rally will prove. Even with the Fed’s pro-economic-growth stance, there are plenty of remaining risks to the global economy — and therefore to financial markets. Chief among those is the possibility that huge economies in China, Japan and Germany sputter.“The Fed has applied a Band-Aid onto a broken arm,” said Frances Donald, head of macroeconomic strategy at asset manager Manulife in Toronto. “This is enough to give us a moment to alleviate our worst concerns. But it doesn’t solve the underlying problem, which is a sizable growth slowdown.”Get the DealBook newsletter to make sense of major business and policy headlines — and the power-brokers who shape them.__________Bets on Big Tech became, in Wall Street parlance, crowded last year.The belief that shares of the world’s tech giants — Alibaba, Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Baidu, Facebook, Netflix and Tencent — would continue to rise became universally popular among some of the biggest names in investing.Last quarter, sentiment reversed, and those same investors dumped their shares.Investment firms run by George Soros and David Tepper unloaded their shares of Apple during the fourth quarter, according to filings Thursday with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The hedge fund Jana Partners also reduced its stake in the iPhone maker last quarter.Even Berkshire Hathaway, which has spent the past three years gobbling up shares of Apple, cut back its holdings in the company.And Apple was not the only tech titan that big investors were selling last quarter.Jana, along with Third Point, sold all its shares in Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce giant. Third Point exited its position in Netflix. Leon Cooperman’s firm, Omega Advisors, sold its stake in Facebook and reduced its holdings in Alphabet. And Tiger Global Management decreased its holdings in Amazon.The filings are the latest evidence of how quickly investors soured on Big Tech late last year as the industry’s woes mounted. A stream of revelations about privacy lapses and security issues had raised the specter of increased regulation on both sides of the Atlantic. But of more immediate concern for investors late last year was whether these companies could continue to grow amid a slowing global economy and an escalating trade war between China and the United States.Over the final three months of last year, tech shares dropped 13 percent to 30 percent, erasing more than $1 trillion in market value. By comparison, the S&P 500 fell 14 percent.The selling signaled a swift shift in sentiment among big hedge funds. Many of these fund managers had struggled to beat the broader market in recent years. So as tech stocks soared and drove much of the broader market’s gains, hedge funds crammed their portfolios with their shares.The selling caught the hedge fund industry off guard, and their losses mounted during the fourth-quarter tumult in the stock market.So far this year, shares of the tech companies have recovered, but most have not fared as well as the S&P 500.Earnings for the final three months of 2018 were better than investors feared, but they did not inspire confidence that Big Tech would weather a global economic slowdown well, particularly in China.Whether investors will pile back into tech stocks will probably depend on the outcome of trade talks between China and the United States. Until then, many investors may stay on the sidelines.(Reuters) - Shares in Levi Strauss & Co surged 31 percent in their debut on Thursday, giving the jeans maker a market value of $8.7 billion and suggesting strong investor appetite before much-awaited listings from Lyft and Uber.The 165-year-old U.S. company's return to the public market comes at a time when stocks are near all-time highs and the popularity of denim is surging, driven by the resurgence of 1990s styles such as high-waist and pinstriped jeans."I'm not going to live or die by what the stock does day in and day out," Chief Executive and President Chip Bergh said in a telephone interview. "We're here to run the business for the long term. It is humbling that the stock was so well received today. That is pretty awesome."The self-proclaimed inventor of the blue jeans, which has grown to become one of the world's most recognized denim brands, Levi Strauss hopes to use a part of the proceeds from the IPO to expand in emerging markets such as Brazil, China and India."Denim continues to prove prevalent in streetwear and on the runway, so we're not expecting it to go anywhere anytime soon," an analyst at retail analytics firm Edited said. "That's why now is a great time for Levi's to capitalize on this momentum."Levi accounted for 5 percent of the global jeans market in 2018, according to market research firm Euromonitor. The market has remained flat from 2013 to 2018, but is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 2 percent until 2023 if prices remain at 2018 levels. Going forward, Bergh also said Levi can double its business in Asia in the next couple of years "and then double it again".Levi does not disclose its earnings in China but Bergh said it makes up around a quarter of its total Asia business, which had just over $800 million in revenue last year.Levi first went public in 1971. It then sold 1.27 million shares at $47 each and the stock opened at $60, according to a New York Times report. After 14 years, it was taken private by the Haas family, the descendants of founder Levi Strauss, in a $1.6 billion leveraged buyout.Levi's second IPO was priced at $17, above the expected range, in an oversubscribed offering. By Thursday afternoon, the shares had hit a high of $23.15.Levi's market splash marks the start of what could be a blockbuster year for IPOs with several high profile companies expected to list their shares.Ride-hailing service provider Lyft Inc kicked off the investor road show for its market debut on Monday, while larger rival Uber is expected to go public in April.The line-up also includes photo-posting app Pinterest and business messaging app Slack.The Haas family, which has over 100 members and is between its fifth and sixth generations, according to Bergh, will retain 80 percent voting control of the public company. Bergh said a desire among existing shareholders to diversify, coupled with strong corporate performance and supportive market conditions, led to the decision to go public in 2019. "The market is pretty ripe and we're the first big IPO of the year," he said. "There was a lot of pent-up demand because it's been pretty slow the last couple of months and that was also probably a tail-wind for us."The company's $8.7 billion market capitalization at the start of trading is based on outstanding shares of about 390 million, which includes the over-allotment option."There is a lot to like when it comes to Levi Strauss the brand and its outlook moving forward," said Jeff Zell, senior research analyst and partner at IPO tracking firm, IPO Boutique."The company and the underwriters targeted a reasonable valuation to start and allowed the true investor demand to dictate price which ultimately came one dollar above range."Levi's revenue rose 14 percent to $5.6 billion in 2018, the bulk of which came from men's denim. Its biggest market is the Americas, accounting for 55 percent of overall revenue.The San Francisco-based company sells in 110 countries through 50,000 retail stores, and its rivals include Gap Inc and VF Corp's Lee and Wrangler brands.To attract young customers, Levi's is planning to expand its tailor shop and print bar that allow consumers to customize and put their own designs on the company's branded jeans and T-shirts.

Graphic: Falling financial market volatility (https://tmsnrt.rs/2ULmq9z)  (Reporting by Josephine Mason; Editing by Catherine Evans)LONDON — The hardline stance by European Union regulators on share trading could split markets and damage prices for investors if there is a no-deal Brexit next week, a top exchanges industry official said on Wednesday.The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) on Tuesday identified 6,200 shares that EU investors can only trade inside the bloc if Britain left without a deal on March 29.Britain's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) hit back, saying that ESMA's stance risked disrupting markets, raising fears of a tit-for-tat move to force UK customers to trade EU shares only in London and thereby splitting liquidity.Alasdair Haynes, chief executive of Aquis Exchange, said that a "horror story" could be unfolding for markets. "Is this a land grab? To a certain extent," he told Reuters.Launched in November 2013, Aquis now accounts for about 4 percent of pan-European share trading, using a novel form of pricing to take on incumbents such as Cboe, which has more than a fifth of the market.AHaynes, a 40-year veteran in the industry, said he has never seen such an overt clash between regulators."It was a pretty harsh response," he said. "This is regulators fighting in public. Your chances for equivalence went out the door last night."Brussels has said that clearing houses in London would gain equivalence for a year if there is a no-deal Brexit, meaning that EU customers could continue using them for a limited time.This was not extended to trading platforms in London, used by asset managers and banks from across the continent.Christian Voigt, senior regulatory adviser at trading technology firm Fidessa, said emotions were running high after ESMA's statement left market participants disappointed."While arguing what the regulator could have done, we shouldn't forget that it is all caused by a political decision not to grant equivalence," Voigt said.PARIS PILOTAquis, Cboe Europe, CME and other trading platforms in London have opened EU operations to avoid disruption to customers from Brexit.Banks have moved a trillion pounds in assets such as stocks, bonds and derivatives owned by EU customers to hubs in the bloc to trade there.Aquis began testing trading from Paris on Wednesday, Haynes said.Trading in euro-denominated shares is likely to remain in London for now if Brexit is delayed, as requested by the British government, or a transition deal is agreed, he added.The Paris operation would increase overall costs for Aquis by about 5 percent, though most of this has already been incurred, Haynes said.Aquis revenue doubled to 4 million pounds in 2018, when it made a loss of 2.7 million pounds, having invested heavily on developing its technology and licensing arm. It floated last June with listing costs totalling a million pounds.Haynes said analysts expect Aquis to become profitable in 2020 and that he is comfortable with those expectations.

Sowing DoubtThis stock market rally hasn’t been as intense as many others that preceded it.By Stephen GrocerMarch 9, 2019Ten years ago, when the global financial crisis seemed at its worst, the stock market hit rock bottom.The bull run that has followed now ranks among the greatest rallies of the past century: The S&P 500 has more than quadrupled, adding $17.5 trillion in value, and, of the 11 bull markets since the end of World War II, only the run that ended with the bursting of the dot-com bubble in 2000 tops the current one in duration and returns.But despite the superlatives, this rally’s primary characteristic is how much skepticism it generated. The intensity of gains that defined the stock market bubbles of the 1920s and 1990s never developed. Instead, many investors spent the past decade deriding the rally and anticipating its demise.Bull markets are usually driven by a strengthening economy that fuels corporate profits. But the economic scars of the downturn a decade ago were deep and the recovery slow. For much of the past decade, economic growth remained lackluster; corporate earnings, at least until last year, were uninspiring; and the global economy bounced from one crisis to the next. There was the sovereign debt crisis that wracked the eurozone, concerns about the health of China’s economy and its growing debt load, tumbling oil prices that dragged down energy-sector profits, and, most recently, concerns about global economy and trade.True, the bull market never succumbed to these worries (although it came awfully close more than once). Credit for that goes to the world’s central banks whose efforts to keep interest rates low made bond investments and other alternatives unappealing, and kept fueling the stock buying. This is not to say that investors weren’t excited about some stocks. Investors piled into shares of Alphabet, Amazon, Apple and Microsoft and those four stock had a big effect on the S&P 500, particularly in the last few years. Over the past decade, and factoring in dividends, the four biggest tech companies accounted for 9 percent of the gains in the S&P 500, according to data from Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst for S&P Dow Jones Indices.When it comes to actual performance of their shares, Alphabet and Microsoft gained more than 600 percent over the past decade, while Apple jumped nearly 1,400 percent and Amazon surged nearly 2,600 percent.It wasn’t just the tech companies themselves that fared well. The best-performing bank stock over the past decade was SVB Financial, Silicon Valley’s so-called hometown bank, which rose almost 1,900 percent. For all the attention paid to technology shares though, the honor of best-performing stock in the S&P 500 over the past decade actually goes to Ulta Beauty, the cosmetics retailer. Its shares have surged more than 7,000 percent.NEW YORK — The Latest on Levi Strauss & Co.'s initial public offering (all times local):4:45 p.m.Shares of Levi Strauss surged after it began trading as public company for the second time in the clothing brand's 166-year history.The shares were priced Wednesday at $17 and opened for trading Thursday at $22.22, a gain of 31 percent.

Ride-hailing company Lyft will sell shares to the public next week, and larger rival Uber is expected to go public later this spring.____11:10 a.m.Shares of Levi Strauss & Co. are soaring as the company goes public again.

On Friday, stock investors caught a whiff, too.Economic forecasters and Wall Street traders have been watching for months as interest rates on long-term United States government bonds have dropped toward the rates on short-term debt.Investors normally demand higher yields to buy longer-term bonds, and when those long-term yields decline it can signal a slowdown in economic growth. On rare occasions, long-term yields can actually fall below yields on short-term bonds — a “yield curve inversion” in the parlance of the markets. Such unusual occurrences have preceded every recession over the last 60 years.And it happened on Friday. The inversion followed a sharp decline on yields on long-term Treasury bonds this week after the Federal Reserve decided on Wednesday to leave interest rates unchanged and signaled that it was unlikely to raise rates through the end of 2019. But a round of dour economic data from Europe actually pushed the measure into inverted territory. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note tumbled to 2.44 percent Friday, its lowest level since January 2018. That was just below the 2.45 percent yield on three-month Treasury bills. There are many different ways to measure the yield curve. On Wall Street, many analysts look at the difference between yields on two-year and 10-year Treasury notes, which has not yet inverted. But research from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco has cited the yield difference between three-month Treasury bills and 10-year Treasury notes — which inverted Friday — as the most reliable predictor of recession risk. Traders in the stock market picked up on the downbeat signal. The S&P 500 had been climbing despite a recent drop in bond yields, effectively shrugging off the decline as further evidence that the Fed would keep rates low for the foreseeable future. Keeping rates low has been a good thing for stocks over the past 10 years. But on Friday, the S&P 500 fell 1.9 percent, as stock market investors grew concerned about the outlook for economic growth. It was the second-worst drop for the market this year. The Nasdaq composite index fell 2.5 percent. Experts on interpreting the predictive power of the yield curve cautioned that a single day of an inverted yield curve doesn’t necessarily mean the economy will tumble into recession. Campbell Harvey, a Duke University finance professor whose research first showed the predictive power of the yield curve in the mid-1980s, stressed that an inversion must last, on average, three months before it can credibly be said to be sending a clear signal. If that does occur, history shows that the economy will fall into a recession over the next nine to 18 months. But even with the yield curve’s track record for predicting recessions, Professor Harvey emphasized that there was no such thing as certainty in economic forecasting. “A model is just a model,” he said. “It’s not an oracle. It helps us forecast the future, but it might at any point fail.”The Bull Market Began 10 Years Ago. Why Aren’t More People Celebrating?Americans are still scarred by the financial crisis, and the fruits of this decade’s record-breaking rally fell mostly to the rich.By Matt PhillipsMarch 9, 2019The financial system had nearly collapsed. The deepest recession in decades was devouring over 700,000 jobs a month. Roughly $13 trillion in stock market wealth, slowly rebuilt since the dot-com bust, had again been incinerated. It was March 2009. And it was one of the best times in a generation to buy stocks.A decade later, the bull market that began back then ranks among the great rallies in stock-market history. The 305 percent surge in the S&P 500 is the index’s second-best run ever.The rise has generated more than $30 trillion in wealth. Adjusted for inflation, that is the most created during any bull run on record, edging out the $25 trillion in gains during the epic streak from December 1987 to March 2000, which ended with the bursting of the dot-com bubble, according to Federal Reserve data.But compared with Americans’ attitudes during that earlier climb, reactions to the latest rally are downright subdued. There has been no frenzy for stock trading. Nobody is quitting an accounting, advertising, or waitressing job to concentrate on day trading.Why so somber? The psychological and financial damage inflicted by the 2008 financial crisis and the ensuing Great Recession continue to weigh heavily. Fewer people are invested in stocks than before that meltdown, and many of them are wary of taking their gains for granted. That caution could last for decades.“This was probably the most disliked or most suspected rally that we’ve ever had in the stock market,” said Charles Geisst, a professor at Manhattan College who has studied the history of financial markets. Birth of the BullOn March 9, 2009, the day the bull market was born, the stock market, like the economy, was in deep, seemingly existential distress. The S&P 500 was down 57 percent from its 2007 peak. Compounding the pain was the nationwide collapse in home prices, which landed a direct hit on most households’ greatest source of wealth. The one-two punch destroyed the finances of millions of families. Between 2007 and 2010, the median wealth of a household in the United States dropped 44 percent, knocked below 1969 levels.Every crash has a bottom, though, and in March 2009, the Federal Reserve announced that it would spend $1 trillion in newly created dollars on government and mortgage bonds to push interest rates lower. It was the dawn of “quantitative easing” — and, it would turn out, a new bull market. The S&P 500 rose 8.5 percent that month, its best monthly performance in more than six years.“That should have been the signal to everyone that you can go out there and buy stocks with impunity,” said Byron Wien, vice chairman of the private wealth group at Blackstone, the private equity firm.But to buy stocks, you need money. After watching their fortunes — and retirement funds — shrivel, few Americans were in a position to take a fresh flier on beaten-down stocks.Those who could were already well-off. In 2007, the wealthiest 10 percent of American families owned 81 percent of the nation’s household stock market wealth, according Ed Wolff, a professor of economics at New York University who studies the distribution of wealth in the United States. By 2016, they owned 84 percent, he said.The recovery in the stock market made those families even richer, increasing their net worth by double-digit percentages. Median American family wealth, meanwhile, dropped 34 percent.In the past, such episodes of wealth destruction cast long shadows. For much of the 20th century, the financial habits of the American public were heavily influenced by memories of the Great Depression.Even in the 1960s, survey data showed that people who were young during the Great Depression were much less likely to invest in stocks, according to research by two economists, Ulrike Malmendier of the University of California, Berkeley, and Stefan Nagel of the University of Chicago. The 2008 crisis was nowhere near as severe, but a similar dynamic may be affecting people who started their working lives around that time.Gallup survey data shows that in the last decade, an average of 38 percent of Americans under the age of 35 have money invested in the stock market. That compares with 52 percent before the crisis. Playing It SafeEven those who are invested are behaving differently, both in how they invest and what they’re doing with the proceeds. In the decade since the bull market began, the share of Americans investing via index funds, which aim to mimic the performance of benchmarks like the S&P 500, has increased significantly. In 2017, 43 percent of all the money in American stock market funds was in index funds. Back in 2007, only 19 percent of stock market assets were in these passive strategies, a style of investing that acknowledges that, for most people, trying to beat the market through savvy trading is a mug’s game.Americans also appear to be less willing than in previous booms to let the rise in stock market wealth on paper lead to a surge in spending. Family savings rates have stayed stubbornly high by historical standards.“Households continue to kind of treat their capital gains, realized or unrealized, more cautiously than they did in the 1990s or the 2000s,” said Michael Feroli, chief United States economist at J.P. Morgan.In part, this is because many stock owners are baby boomers, who might have enjoyed spending their stock market gains 20 years ago but are now more worried about preserving wealth as they retire. Fred Wallace, a 64-year-old retired HBO executive in Los Angeles is one of them. When the stock market took a dive in December, he cut his holdings of stock and moved money into cash and bonds.“That allows you to sleep at night because you know that if stocks tank it doesn’t really matter,” Mr. Wallace said. But even among Americans who are just starting their careers, this risk-aversion could linger. Research from Ms. Malmendier and Mr. Nagel, the economists, suggests that enduring financial traumas at a relatively young age can shape people’s behavior for decades. Younger Americans, Ms. Malmendier said, are unlikely to be eager to take big risks in the stock market any time soon.“We don’t see that happening,” she said. “People were scarred from that experience.”
